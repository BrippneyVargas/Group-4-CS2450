PERSONAL REFLECTION
SPRINT 1

JACOB WEST
What excites you most about this project?

- I think it's going to be fun and interesting to collaborate with people exactly how a lot of people
  in the industry collaborate! This is a great way to start getting used to regular workflows and team structures
  and iterative improvement processes.

Whatâ€™s one thing you want to improve during this milestone?

- I think we need to further define the steps of each milestone that we want to accomplish, and maybe add a fun
  feature or two. I have some ideas that I'll pitch as we go, but we'll see what happens.

Overall, I like my group and I'm really enjoying the class!
