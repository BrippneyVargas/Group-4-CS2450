SRS: Devin and Brippney will take the lead on this, but work with Vlad and Keomony to be create this document.

USER STORIES:
We created a google doc to create a series of user stories that we can use to guide us through the project

VISION STATEMENT:
We are thinking of building this in the form of a website so that it is easy to share and interact with.
We are likely going to learn more about what this is supposed to look like in class next week, so we took some notes and did a bit of brainstorming.
Essentially our idea is that this is going to be an app focused on individual users rather than teams, but that you had some functionality to share tasks.

STACK/TECHNOLOGIES:

- Flask for the backend
- REST API for interacting between frontend/backend
- Frontend in HTML, CSS, JS
- Launch with Netlify?
- Something for the database (mysql or postgresql, ideally something free)

_Non-Functional Requirements:_
Ensure privacy and security such as user authentication or else.
Simple but aesthetic interface that is user-friendly and easy to navigate.  
The system should load the dashboard within 2 seconds.
The response time for adding, updating, or deleting tasks should be less than 1 second.
The application should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing users and tasks. .

_Future Enhancements Section:_
A list of advanced features brainstormed by the team.
Using Flask
Recurring task
AI powered Task Automation
Implement AI-driven task suggestions based on user behavior and priorities
Use natural language processing to allow users to create tasks via voice or chat.
Introduce automated reminders and follow-ups based on task deadlines and urgency.
Security & Privacy Enhancements
Offer end-to-end encryption for sensitive task data.
Provide automatic daily cloud backups.

_Individual Reflection Questions_
What excites you most about this project?
Getting to work as a team and getting to know about the software engineering cycle as if I am in the real world.
Whatâ€™s one thing you want to improve during this milestone?

_Project Vision Statement that answers:_
What is the purpose of the Task Manager?: to allow for the creation, tracking, and completion of tasks.
What problems does it solve?: the human mind has limited working memory, and therefore it is necessary to write down tasks that need to be completed in some space. This app is one of those spaces.
Who are the target users, and how will they benefit?: people with smartphones and lots of tasks that need doing everyday. Examples may include small business owners, parents, teachers, students, local political leaders, etc.

_Brainstorm Project Ideas_

- Mobile responsiveness
- Offline support
- UI Customization

**What's Next:**

- Project Vision Statement (started, just need to complete)
- Complete the SRS
- Organize the user stories and features into an order
- Assign points and determine what will be completed at the end of each milestone

USER STORIES:

As a person who has to take medication at the same time every day, I want repeatable reminders (series) that I can define the timeframe of so I do not have to repeatedly set the same reminders.
As an impulsive person, I want to be able to recover tasks that I deleted within a set time period in case I want to recover in case I delete something I should not have. As a person who gets lost in my notes if they are not organized, 3. I would like to be able to label my tasks. Tagging something as pertaining to school or work will hopefully help me stay on track and not get lost in an avalanche of notes.
As a person who gets overwhelmed, I would like to not have all my notes in one place. Instead, I would like them to be divided into different folders or pages by type. This will make the app a lot more usable for me.
As a person who tends to ignore a lot of my phone notifications, I would like to be able to decide the priority of tasks I make and how I am reminded of tasks of varying priority. This will help me not ignore more important tasks.
As a person who uses their phone too much at night, I would like to be able to set the app to use a light or dark theme, or to default to my device's settings. This will make my experience using the app at varying times of day more enjoyable.
As a person who values customization and visual learning, I would like to be able to change the colors of each task I create. This will help me more quickly identify which task I want to find.
As a user, I want to add notes to tasks, so I can keep additional details for each task.
As a user, I want to make my tasks private but also enable sharing if I want to.
As a user who wants to feel accomplished, I want to be able to mark a task as complete. This will allow me to know what I have done and still have yet to do in a given day.
As a busy person, I want an app that loads quickly and experiences few performance hiccups. This will help me be more efficient with my time.
As a person whose eyesight is worsening, I would like to be able to change the size of the font inside the app. This will lessen the strain on my eyes.
As a normal person, I want an app with few visual glitches and bugs. Iwant something pleasing to look at and that will not delete my tasks. My day would go a whole lot better that way.
As a person who speaks multiple languages, I would like to be able to change the language the app uses. This will make it easier when I forget what a certain button does.
As a person who forgets to lock the door when I leave work, I would like to be able to remind myself to do so when I get too far from where I work. This would help me not get in trouble with security.
