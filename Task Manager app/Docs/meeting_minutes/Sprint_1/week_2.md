8pm Online Meeting

Jacob: Recorder
Brippney: Scrum Master
Keomony: Developer
Devin: Product Owner
Vlad: Developer (wasn't able to make it to this meeting)

**TODO:**

- Define the schedule for each user role
- Work on User Stories

We spent time creating the role schedules for each milestone:

MILESTONE 1:
Product Owner: Devin
Scrum Master: Brippney
Recorder: Jacob
Developer 1: Keomony
Developer 2: Vlad

MILESTONE 2:
Product Owner: Brippney
Scrum Master: Keomony
Recorder: Vlad
Developer 1: Jacob
Developer 2: Devin

MILESTONE 3:
Product Owner: Keomony
Scrum Master: Jacob
Recorder: Devin
Developer 1: Vlad
Developer 2: Brippney

MILESTONE 4:
Product Owner: Jacob
Scrum Master: Vlad
Recorder: Brippney
Developer 1: Keomony
Developer 2: Devin

MILESTONE 5:
Product Owner: Vlad
Scrum Master: Devin
Recorder: Keomony
Developer 1: Jacob
Developer 2: Brippney

SRS: Devin and Brippney will take the lead on this, but work with Vlad and Keomony to be create this document.

USER STORIES:
We created a google doc to create a series of user stories that we can use to guide us through the project

VISION STATEMENT:
We are thinking of building this in the form of a website so that it is easy to share and interact with.
We are likely going to learn more about what this is supposed to look like in class next week, so we took some notes and did a bit of brainstorming.
Essentially our idea is that this is going to be an app focused on individual users rather than teams, but that you had some functionality to share tasks.

STACK/TECHNOLOGIES:

- Flask for the backend
- REST API for interacting between frontend/backend
- Frontend in HTML, CSS, JS
- Launch with Netlify?
- Something for the database (mysql or postgresql, ideally something free)

_Non-Functional Requirements:_
Ensure privacy and security such as user authentication or else.
Simple but aesthetic interface that is user-friendly and easy to navigate.  
The system should load the dashboard within 2 seconds.
The response time for adding, updating, or deleting tasks should be less than 1 second.
The application should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing users and tasks. .

_Future Enhancements Section:_
A list of advanced features brainstormed by the team.
Using Flask
Recurring task
AI powered Task Automation
Implement AI-driven task suggestions based on user behavior and priorities
Use natural language processing to allow users to create tasks via voice or chat.
Introduce automated reminders and follow-ups based on task deadlines and urgency.
Security & Privacy Enhancements
Offer end-to-end encryption for sensitive task data.
Provide automatic daily cloud backups.

_Individual Reflection Questions_
What excites you most about this project?
Getting to work as a team and getting to know about the software engineering cycle as if I am in the real world.
Whatâ€™s one thing you want to improve during this milestone?

_Project Vision Statement that answers:_
What is the purpose of the Task Manager?: to allow for the creation, tracking, and completion of tasks.
What problems does it solve?: the human mind has limited working memory, and therefore it is necessary to write down tasks that need to be completed in some space. This app is one of those spaces.
Who are the target users, and how will they benefit?: people with smartphones and lots of tasks that need doing everyday. Examples may include small business owners, parents, teachers, students, local political leaders, etc.

_Brainstorm Project Ideas_

- Mobile responsiveness
- Offline support
- UI Customization

**What's Next:**

- Project Vision Statement (started, just need to complete)
- Complete the SRS
- Organize the user stories and features into an order
- Assign points and determine what will be completed at the end of each milestone
