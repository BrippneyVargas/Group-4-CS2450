3:50pm

Everyone is here!

Attendence:

- **Devin**: Product Owner  
- **Vlad**: Developer  
- **Brippney**: Scrum Master  
- **Keomony**: Developer  
- **Jacob**: Recorder  

Discussion about whether we should do a Task Manager or if we should switch to something else.
Vlad suggested that we do a game instead (like Sudoku, Minesweeper, etc.)

Project Scope and Features:
As a person who has to take medication at the same time every day, I want repeatable reminders (series) that we can define the timeframe of.

- Reminders
- Task scheduling (with repeatability, set number of times to repeat, repeat on certain days, expiration, etc.)
  Adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Confirm if they actually want that, make it reversable (archive?)
  Milestone markers/status
- Open
- In progress
- Completed
- Late
  Synchronize with a calendar?
- Calendar invites? MAYBE

Prioritize tasks, include possibility for deadlines

Reminders for task completion? Let the user define their reminder frequency (if they want them)

Focus: SINGLE PERSON, not team-oriented.

Collaborate tasks with other users?

OVERVIEW:
Project Scope:

- Made for individual users, not necessarily groups (although we could add group collaboration if we have the bandwidth)
- Reminders
- Task scheduling
  - Repeatability feature (set frequency and expiration date)
  - Add, edit, and delete
  - When deleting, don't completely remove; archive the data so that it can be recovered (reversibility)
  - Milestones (Open, In Progress, Completed, Late, Expired, etc.)
  - If we have bandwidth we can sync it to a calendar of the users choice (maybe we offer a few options like iPhone, Outlook, and Google Calendar)
  - Task prioritizing (low, medium, high)
  - Categorize tasks (school, chores, maintenance, family, etc.)

Technology:

- Python
- Flask/Django for web framework?
- HTML/CSS?
- MySQL or SQLite for the database
  (do we need to host our project somewhere?)

Goals for next meeting:

- Further define the scope/features
  - WE NEED TO UPDATE THE SRS (See Milestone 1): Jacob
- Assign points to each item in the product backlog: Keomony, Vlad
- Set up our first sprint: Devin, Brippney
  - Product Owner and Scrum Master will determine what will go into the sprint backlog for the developers
    - Based on number of points
  - Product Owner & Scrum Master add the sprint backlog items to the GitHub project
