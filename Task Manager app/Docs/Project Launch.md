## Project Vision Statement

The Task Manager Application is designed to help users efficiently organize and prioritize their personal tasks. Tailored for students, professionals, or anyone managing daily responsibilities, the app provides a simple and intuitive solution for task scheduling, setting repeatable reminders, and tracking milestones.

Key features include customizable reminders, task scheduling with repeatability options, and the ability to categorize and prioritize tasks. Tasks can also be archived rather than deleted, ensuring that users can recover important information when needed. The application focuses on empowering users to stay organized and manage their time effectively.

The app’s core goal is to support productivity and time management by offering an accessible tool to keep track of tasks, deadlines, and priorities—designed specifically for users.

### Brainstorming Summary

#### Core Functionalities Agreed Upon:

1. **Reminders**:
   - Repeatable reminders for tasks, allowing users to define frequency and expiration dates. For example, reminders for medication that need to repeat every day or week, and have a defined end time.
2. **Task Scheduling**:
   - Add, edit, and delete tasks with flexibility for users to manage their to-do lists.
   - **Reversibility**: Deleted tasks won’t be permanently erased but archived, providing users with the ability to recover them if necessary.
3. **Milestones/Task Statuses**:

   - Tasks will have status markers such as:
     - Open
     - In Progress
     - Completed
     - Late
     - Expired

4. **Task Prioritization**:

   - Ability to prioritize tasks (low, medium, high) so users can focus on what matters most.

5. **Task Categorization**:
   - Tasks can be categorized into different types, such as:
     - School
     - Chores
     - Maintenance
     - Family
     - Etc.

#### Advanced Features to Explore if Time Permits:

1. **Calendar Synchronization**:
   - If resources allow, the app can sync with a calendar (Google Calendar, iPhone, Outlook) so that users can see tasks and reminders alongside their personal events.
2. **Collaborative Tasks**:
   - Although the app is designed for individual users, collaborative tasking could be added later. This would allow users to share tasks or collaborate on projects with others.

#### Unique Ideas/Twists that Differentiate the Project:

1. **Focus on Individual Users**:

   - The app is specifically designed for individual use, with features to manage personal tasks. Unlike traditional team-oriented task managers, it will prioritize individual task management but could eventually support group features if bandwidth allows.

2. **Task Reversibility**:

   - Instead of deleting tasks permanently, the app will archive tasks. This ensures that users don’t lose important data and can recover tasks if needed.

3. **Customizable Reminders**:

   - Customizable reminder frequencies for tasks, allowing users to adjust reminders to suit their needs, from daily medication reminders to monthly recurring tasks.

4. **Task Categorization and Prioritization**:
   - Providing detailed task categorization (e.g., school, chores, family) and prioritization ensures that users can manage different aspects of their life and make sure they’re completing the most important tasks first.
