Discussion about whether we should do a Task Manager or if we should switch to something else.
Vlad suggested that we do a game instead (like Sudoku, Minesweeper, etc.)

Project Scope and Features: 
As a person who has to take medication at the same time every day, I want repeatable reminders (series) that we can define the timeframe of.
- Reminders
- Task scheduling (with repeatability, set number of times to repeat, repeat on certain days, expiration, etc.)
Adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Confirm if they actually want that, make it reversable (archive?)
Milestone markers/status
- Open
- In progress
- Completed
- Late 
Synchronize with a calendar?
- Calendar invites? MAYBE

Prioritize tasks, include possibility for deadlines

Reminders for task completion? Let the user define their reminder frequency (if they want them)


Focus: SINGLE PERSON, not team-oriented.

Collaborate tasks with other users?
